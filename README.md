# Dijkstra-algorithm

Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to implement a program that computes the shortest distance between two nodes of an undirected weighted graph. Once Dijsktra’s algorithm has executed, use its output to automatically identify a shortest path in the graph.

@Input:

The graph, given by providing in sequence: the number of nodes, then a sequence of arcs with associated length.
The source.
The destination.



@Output:

The shortest distance.
A shortest path.

#  Show the shortest path and distance from JFK to LAX
